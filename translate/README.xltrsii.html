<A NAME = "INTRO">
The first thing</a> that needs to be done in order to look at radar data
is to get it on disk in a format acceptable to <b>SOLO</b>. This is
one of the purposes of the <B>Data Translator</B>. The
<b>Translator</B> accepts several formats of radar data and produces
one or more products. Most often the product is
<b>DORADE</b> sweepfiles, which are used by <b>SOLO</b> to display
the data. The translator can also produce a catalog of the data, and
DORADE, UF format output tapes and netCDF sweepfiles.
<P>

<P> The input formats that can be handled by the translator are
DORADE_FORMAT, WSR_88D_FORMAT, UF_FORMAT, NCAR's FOF_FORMAT,
HRD_FORMAT and NETCDF_FORMAT. References to P3 and HRD are considered
synonymous in this context.  In addition in-house formats
(e.g., ELDORA_FORMAT and PIRAQ_FORMAT) may be used as input to
<b>SOLO</b>.<P>

 <p>
<p>
Translators are driven with environment variables usually set in a 
script file. This file can be named by the user and must be executable. 
To make a file executable the protection must be changed with the chmod 
command.For example:
<P>
<pre>
	chmod 755 <i>script_file_name</i>
</pre>
<P>

This will give the owner, group and world executable privileges while 
providing only the owner with read and write abilities. <P>
<A NAME = "BAM">A typical script might look like:</A>

<pre>
        # Batch Mode C-Shell script to produce dorade sweep files
	# from WSR_88D radar tapes
	#
	setenv BATCH_MODE  # omit for interactive mode
	setenv INPUT_FORMAT "WSR_88D_FORMAT"
	setenv OUTPUT_FLAGS "SWEEP_FILES"
	setenv DORADE_DIR /scr/mead/nexrad
	setenv PROJECT_NAME "NEXRAD"
	setenv RADAR_NAME "KFTG"
	setenv COMPRESSION_SCHEME "HRD_COMPRESSION"
	setenv TIME_LIMITS "08/03/94:21:30 < 08/03/94:23:30"
	setenv FIXED_ANGLES "0.0 < 2.0 4.0 < 5.0"
	setenv SOURCE_DEV /dev/nexa
	nice +11 /local/bin/xltrsii  # be sure to specify the proper 
			 	     # path to the translator
        #
</pre>
<P>

Typing this executable script name at the prompt should create
compressed sweep files and a catalog of scans with elevation angles
between 0 and 2 degrees and 4 and 5 degrees in the "/scr/mead/nexrad"
directory for the time period indicated on August 3, 1994 from the
data tape in the source device /dev/nexa. The last line of the script
invokes the actual translator program. Be sure that the full pathname
of the executable is specified, or that your environment variable
"PATH" is set to include the proper version of the executable.  When 
substituting your source device, be sure to specify a device name 
which is Berkeley compatible.  On Suns running Solaris, this might
be /dev/rmt/0bn. If you are not sure which device to use, check with
your system administrator. <P>

<A NAME = "TIM">Interactive mode</A> is also available. The script for
the interactive mode can be exactly the same as the batch mode but the
line "<tt>setenv <b>BATCH_MODE</b></tt>" must be removed. A <A NAME =
"IAM">typical</A> interactive mode script might look like: <P>

<pre>
	# Interactive mode C-Shell script to produce dorade sweep files
	# from WSR_88D radar tapes
	#
	setenv INPUT_FORMAT "WSR_88D_FORMAT"
	setenv OUTPUT_FLAGS "SWEEP_FILES"
	setenv DORADE_DIR /scr/mead/nexrad
	setenv PROJECT_NAME "NEXRAD"
	setenv RADAR_NAME "KFTG"
	setenv COMPRESSION_SCHEME "HRD_COMPRESSION"
	setenv SOURCE_DEV /dev/nexa
	nice +11 /local/bin/xltrsii
	#
</pre>
<P>

To invoke the translator, type the script filename at the prompt. The 
following menu should appear:
<P>

<PRE> 
	-1 = exit program (-2 exits from some other prompts)
         0 = continue
	 1 = repeat last run
</PRE> 
<P>

You are now in the interactive version of the translator. Typing a 0
and hitting <b>&lt;return&gt;</b>, or just hitting
<b>&lt;return&gt;</b> should bring up the next menu which looks like
the following: <P>

<PRE>
	-2 = Exit
	-1 = Begin processing
	 0 = Skip rays
	 1 = Inventory
	 2 = Skip files
	 3 = Rewind
	 4 = 16-bit integers
	 5 = hex display
	 6 = dump as characters
	 7 = Skip records
	 8 = Forward time skip
	 9 = Fixed angle search
	10 = Set Input Limits
	11 = Display headers
	12 = Display data
	13 = Time correction
	14 = Sweep time tolerance
	15 = Rotation angle tolerance
	Option =
</PRE>
<P>

This version of the translator gives you more flexibility to move
around in and familiarize yourself with what the data contain, whereas
batch mode is more useful if you are familiar with the data and with
exactly what times and angles you want to use. The following is a
brief description of the options in the above menu.<P>

<P>
<PRE>
 -1 =	Begin processing the data by loading in the number of
	scans specified in option 10 of the menu or by cataloging
	the data, whichever was specified in the script. After
	the requested number of scans have been processed, the program
	looks for an end-of-file mark and then stops. If the number of
	scans is not specified before you begin processing, the
	program will continue until reaching the end-of-tape,
	unless a time limit was specified in the script.

 0 = 	Skip through the data ray by ray. May not go back as far as
	you want because only a certain number of records are kept
	around. This is mainly for formats where there may be several
	rays per physical record like NEXRAD, where you may want to back
	up a few rays.

  1 = 	Inventory the data, beam by beam (display azimuth, elevation, 
	etc., for each beam).

  2 = 	Skip forward and backward through the data by files.

  3 = 	Rewind the tape to the begining.

  4 = 	Display the current record as 16-bit integers.

  5 = 	Display the current record as hexidecimal (base 16). Makes
	it easier to see bit patterns.

  6 = 	Interpret a byte in the data as a character if it can.

  7 =   Move around in the data by records. Negative numbers can
	be used in order to skip back.

  8 = 	Skip ahead in time either by giving a specific time, or by
	specifying the number of hours, minutes, or seconds to skip.

  9 = 	Search forward for a specified fixed angle.   Specify the 
	nominal angle, and a tolerance.  For example, typing <I>2.0 0.5</I>
	would set the translator searching for a fixed angle between,
	and including, 1.5 and 2.5 degrees. You only need to give the 
	range number if you want to change its value other wise the 
	last one used will be remembered.  The default is a 0.2 degree 
	range.

 10 = 	Brings up the following sub-menu, which allows you to set
	different limits for the control of sweep file output.

	 0 = Cease - Go back to previous menu
	 1 = Enter time span - Specify time limits in which data is processed
	 2 = Enter scan count - Set the number of sweep files written to disk
	 3 = Enter volume count - Specifies the number of volumes to process
	 4 = Enter ray count - Number of rays translator will process
	 5 = Enter fixed angle limits - Used if you only want certain angles processed
	 6 = Enter PRF limits - Will only process scans with prf's within this limit
	 7 = Enter num lines in browser display - allows you to customize
	     the number of lines you want the translator to display in
	     your window

 11 = 	Give a listing of the header information.

 12 = 	Show the actual values for each field contained in the
	data.
</PRE>
<P> 

When you are in the options that display headers or data (usually
items after item 10), typing a positive number, <b>n</b>, causes a
redisplay beginning <b>n</b> lines further than the first line in the
current display; typing a negative number causes a redisplay beginning
<b>n</b> lines previous to the first line of the display. Typing a
number that is greater than the number of lines in the listing causes
the final lines in the listing to be displayed, and typing a large
negative number causes the first lines in the listing to be
displayed. To exit the display, type a non-numeric character followed
by a return.<P>

After some data (at least one full sweep) have been loaded to disk,
you are ready to begin using <b>SOLO</b>.  When using the interactive
version of the translator to search through data, you may want to keep
it going in one window and to open <b>SOLO</b> in another. <b>SOLO</b>
is able to see new data as they are read to disk without exiting and
re-entering the program. It may be necessary to "pop up" the <i>sweep
widget</i> and display the list of sweeps to display the newer sweeps,
since <b>SOLO</b> does not rescan the directory for every sweep it
plots.  <P>

You might also find it helpful to use the <b>GNU emacs</b> directory
editor (<b>dired</b>) for selectively <A NAME = "DSW">deleting sweep
files</a>.  On many systems you type <tt>emacs</tt> preferably
from the directory where you want to do the deletion. Then type
<tt>&lt;CTRL&gt;x</tt> and then a <tt>"d"</tt> and you will be
prompted for the directory name.  If you are already in the directory
you can just type <tt>&lt;return&gt;</tt>. Once you have a list of
files you can move around with the arrows and type a <tt>"d"</tt>
at each file you wish to delete.  When you want to delete the files
you have flagged, type an <tt>"x"</tt> and you will get a list of
the files emacs is going to delete. Type <tt>"yes"</tt> to
confirm.  <P>

<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

There are <A NAME = "EVL"><B>many environment variables</B></A>
besides the 
ones listed in the example scripts that can be set to control the translator. 
Some environment variables are unique to certain input formats and
output flags. The user should be aware that on some
systems in certain shells (most notably hpux and the csh environment),
variables <u>must</u> have an argument.  So a variable such as
<B>BATCH_MODE</B> needs to be set with the following command:<br>

<pre>
		setenv BATCH_MODE ""
</pre>
<P>

Since tokens in strings are expected to be seperated by spaces or
tabs, all ordered triplets in environment variables such as
<I>"800 < 2000"</I> in <br>

<pre>
		setenv PRF_LIMITS "800 < 2000"
</pre>

should be seperated by spaces or tabs. The "<" has no significance
except to emphasize the relationship between the two values on either
side.
 <P>

<b>Quotes</b> are needed whenever the value of a variable includes
blanks or unusual characters.  Omission of necessary quotes will cause
unexpected results!<p>

A list of currently defined environment variables follows (in the
list, the environment variable is provided first, followed by an
example of its usage, followed by a description of usage):<P>

<dl>
<dt><b>AC_NETCDF_FILE</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv AC_NETCDF_FILES "/dt/oye/RF05.cdf"</tt><br><br>
	Specifies a merge of RAF netCDF airborne data with the
	radar platform descriptor parameters and also specifies what file is
	to be used.  Currently this should be a "low-rate" tape.
The default set of RAF netCDF field names used is:
<tt>"HGME PITCH ROLL THDG VEWC VNSC VSPD LATC LONC PALT UIC 
        VIC WIC"</tt>.<P>

<dt><b>AC_NETCDF_ALIASES</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv AC_NETCDF_ALIASES "LATC < GLAT LONC < GLON"</tt><BR><br>
	Allows substitution for the default fields of the RAF netCDF aircraft
	data tape which are used to revise various platform descriptor
	parameters. Fields not referenced will use the default name.
If you wish not to replace some of the fields
then you can indicate this with the entry <tt>ROLL < NOT</tt>
and the roll will not be replaced. If you wish to substitude only one
or two fields you can say
<b><tt>"ONLY HGME < HGME  LONC < LON"</tt></b> for example.
<P>

<dt><b>AC_TIME_CORRECTION</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv AC_TIME_CORRECTION -172800.000</tt><BR><br>

	Allows for adjusting the RAF netCDF time stamp the units are
	plus or minus seconds.
<P>

<dt><b>AFT_ANGLE_LIMITS</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv AFT_ANGLE_LIMITS "-25. < -5."</tt><BR><br>
	This applies primarily to HRD data and specifies the limits of the
	elevation angles for the data assigned to be the aft radar.<P>

<dt><b>ALTITUDE_LIMITS</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv ALTITUDE_LIMITS "-2.5 < 22.5"</tt><BR><br>

Specifies the altitude limits for data in km. msl. All data below the
lower limit and above the upper limit will be assigned a bad data flag
and "compressed out" of the dataset, if you are using compression.
The program uses the elevation of the beam and the altitude of the
radar to cutoff the data above and below the two limits.  For aircraft
data, this can cut UF files in half and for DORADE, the average sweep
compresses to one-third its non-compressed size.<P>

<dt><b><a id="AZSC">AZ_SECTORS</a></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv AZ_SECTORS "22.0 < 33.0  66.0 < 77.0"</tt><BR><br>

Ignores data outside the two sets of azimuth limits.<P>

<dt><b>BEAM_COUNT</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv BEAM_COUNT 22</tt><BR><br>

The beam count is a way of stopping the program if you are testing
things.<P>

<dt><b>COMPRESSION_SCHEME</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv COMPRESSION_SCHEME "HRD_COMPRESSION"</tt><BR><br>

Sweep files will probably be one third their normal size when
compressed if they contain aircraft data and appropriate
ALTITUDE_LIMITS are specified. Files are often less than one-third
their normal uncompressed size, especially for NEXRAD data.<BR><br>

This is the only compression scheme we employ at present. The
algorithm compresses on the basis of 16-bit boundaries. It is
run-length-encoded (RLE), and an RLE word indicates either the number
of deleted (bad flagged) 16-bit words or the number of 16-bit words to
follow. The compression is terminated by a 1 in an RLE word.<P>

<dt><b>DERIVED_FIELDS</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv DERIVED_FIELDS "VE < VG VE < VU"</tt><BR><br>

There are several specially derived fields available as part of the
translation process. The first two are for use with aircraft (P3 and ELDORA)
data.<br><br>

<dl>
<dt><tt>"VE < VG VE < VU"</tt></dt>

<dd> The left hand side of the ordered pair indicates the source field
id. The right hand side indicates the destination field id and a
specific process for deriving this field. VG implies just to remove
the aircraft motion from the velocity and force the result velocity
Nyquist interval to be centered on 0 while VU implies to remove any
aircraft motion and try to unfold it.<P>

<dt><tt> "VR < VH"</tt></dt>

<dd> The left hand side of the ordered pair indicates the source field
id. VH implies just to remove the component of aircraft motion from
the velocity. This is meant to be used for ELDORA's new unfolded
velocities.  <P>

<dt><tt>"VE < VT" </tt></dt>

<dd> Generates a field called VT from VE that is thresholded on the
NCP. The NCP field and threshold value is specifield with an
environment variable A second number indicates an upper limit and the
absence of this variable forces the default to 999.
(in this example, everything below .333 is
flagged bad): 

<pre>
        setenv NCP_THRESHOLD_VAL "NCP .333"  </pre>
<p>

<dt><tt> "VE < VW" </tt></dt>

<dd> Generates a field called VW from VE that is thresholded on the
Spectral Width and is specified with an environment variable
(in the following example, everything above 6.0 is flagged bad):<br>

<pre>
        setenv SW_THRESHOLD_VAL "SW 6.0" </pre>
<p>

</dl><p>

It is also possible to threshold on power using the environment variable:<br>
<pre>     setenv PWR_THRESHOLD_VAL "DBZ -12.34" </pre>
It can apply to three cases:<br>

<dl>
<dt><tt>"VE < VP" </tt></dt>

<dd> generates a field, VP, by bad-flagging values in VE with dBZ below
-12.34 <P>

<dt><tt>"DBZ < DP" </tt></dt>

<dd> generates a field DP by bad-flagging values in DBZ below -12.34
<P>

<dt><tt>"DBZ < DT" </tt></dt>

<dd> generates a field DT by bad flagging values in DBZ ABOVE -12.34
<P>
</dl>


<dt><b><a id="DDEV">DORADE_DEV</a></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv DORADE_DEV "/scr/mead/data"</tt><BR><br>

If the string "<tt>/dev</tt>" occurs anywhere in this
specification, the software assumes you will be writing to tape(s); if
not, the software assumes you are specifying a destination directory
for DORADE data different from the <A HREF="#DDIR">DORADE_DIR</A>
directory. The name of the file will be manufactured by the
<b>Translator</b> program. With a /dev it is possible to specify more
than one device name between the double quotes. This feature along
with <A HREF="#MDTS">MAX_DORADE_TAPE_SIZE</A> allows a user to specify
output to more than one physical device and the approximate amount of
data in gigabytes that can be written to a physical device.  <P>

<dt><b><a id="DDIR">DORADE_DIR</a></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv DORADE_DIR "/scr/mead/nexrad"</tt><BR><br>

The destination directory for sweep files and catalog information and,
unless otherwise specified, the destination directory for UF and DORADE
tape image files. Older example scripts may use DD_DIR. They are
synonymous. This variable is not manditory but if you are going to
generate any ouput such as catalogs, sweepfiles, DORADE data, etc., you
will need to set this variable.<P>

<dt><b><A id="DVOLI">DORADE_VOLUME_INTERVAL</A></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv DORADE_VOLUME_INTERVAL 240</tt><BR><br>

Volumes of aircraft data are often very long. This variable is the
maximum length in seconds of a volume of data. Normally for ground
based data it is desirable to respect the volume boundaries of the
original data.<P>

<dt><b>EL_SECTORS</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv EL_SECTORS "0.0 < 0.9  3.3 < 4.4"</tt><BR><br>

Ignores data outside the two sets of elevation limits.<P>

<dt><b>FIXED_ANGLES</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv FIXED_ANGLES "0.0 < 1.0  2.0 < 3.0"</tt><BR><br>

It is possible to filter the data to a specific list of fixed angle
ranges.  This is the way to specify it. The "<" must be present, and
the values on either side of the "<" are inclusive.<P>


<dt><b><A id="IFMT">INPUT_FORMAT</a></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv INPUT_FORMAT "DORADE_FORMAT"</tt><BR><br>

This is a <u><b>mandatory</b></u> variable. Formats with headers
require that the source data device be positioned at the beginning of
a file.  The following formats are recognized; specific notes about
the formats follow.

<pre>	<A HREF="#DDFMT">DORADE_FORMAT</a>
	<A HREF="#ELDFMT">ELDORA_FORMAT</a>
	<A HREF="#FOFFMT">FOF_FORMAT</a>

	<A HREF="#FMT88D">WSR_88D_FORMAT</a>
</pre>
	
<dl>
<dt><tt><a id="DDFMT">DORADE_FORMAT</a></tt></dt>

<dd>This is NCAR's format for airborne radar.
The format was created specifically to meet the needs of the NCAR
<b>ELDORA</b> dual-antenna, dual PRT, multi-frequency, high data rate
system.  Contributions to the format were solicited from NOAA's HRD
and other users of radar data.  The format is highly descriptive, and
can be used for airborne radar, ground-based radar, lidar systems,
and other platforms collecting beam-based data.<p>

What follows is a script for DORADE input. The only required variables
are INPUT_FORMAT, SOURCE_DEV, and DORADE_DIR. This would produce a
catalog of the data in the directory designated by DORADE_DIR.<p>
<pre>
# C-Shell script to produce dorade sweep files
# from DORADE radar tapes or tape images on disk
setenv INPUT_FORMAT "DORADE_FORMAT"
setenv SOURCE_DEV /dev/rmt/0bn  # or a tape image on disk
setenv DORADE_DIR /dt/oye
setenv OUTPUT_FLAGS "NO_CATALOG SWEEP_FILES"
setenv TIME_LIMITS "02/09/93:16:50:50 < 02/09/93:16:53"
setenv COMPRESSION_SCHEME "HRD_COMPRESSION" # to save disk space
nice +11 /rdss/solo/bin/xltrsii
#
</pre>

Other environment variables unique to this format are ASCENDING_ONLY,
TIME_CORRECTION, and OPTIONS "ROT_ANG_SECTORS". ASCENDING_ONLY
eliminates sweeps where the antenna has repositioned to rescan a lower
elevation within the same volume. TIME_CORRECTION expects a floating point
time in seconds to be added to the time stamp of each
beam. ROT_ANG_SECTORS enforces the use of the rotation angle for the
sectors defined by the AZ_SECTORS environment variable.<p>

<dt><tt><a id="FMT88D">WSR_88D_FORMAT</a></tt></dt>

<dd>
This format requires three tables to work properly. These tables
are installed in the <b>SOLO</b>/lib directory, and the translator
will expect to find them there unless the environment variable
NEXRAD_DIR is set.  The file names begin with "nexrad" and end with
".txt". One table is site information that has lat/lon/alt plus
receiver bandwidth and the two pulse durations. The user must supply
the four character radar id to access the proper entry in the table
(use the RADAR_NAME environment variable).  These are text files that
can be examined and changed independent of the software.  Any reliable
information concerning these parameters would be welcome.  The
translator for this format
can also ingest user supplied information such as the lat/lon/alt of
the radar, project name, and site name (use RADAR_LATITUDE,
RADAR_LONGITUDE, RADAR_ALTITUDE, PROJECT_NAME, and SITE_NAME).
See the <A HREF="#BAM">example script</A>.<p>

<A HREF="#OPTS">OPTIONS</A> flags for this format are
NEW_NCDC_BLOCKING, REFLECTIVITY_ONLY, VELOCITY_ONLY, MAX_RANGE and
RANGE_AMB:nnn (nnn is the reflectivity value assigned whan the range
ambiguity flag is set). The NCDC blocking option applies to physical tapes
aquired from NCDC after May 2001. Reflectivity data is normally
truncated at the point where the velocity ends. For MAX_RANGE the gate
spacing becomes 500 meters rather than 250 meters yielding the same
number of gates with decimated velocity data.<p>

If you're using the soloii version of the translators (xltrsii), all
tables used for translating 88D data are internal. If you need to
supply new information not in the internal tables, use the environment
variables described above or if you have and edited version of the
NEXRAD site information file, you can supply it with the
NEXRAD_SITE_INFO environment variable.<p>

<dt><tt><a id="UFFMT">UF_FORMAT</a> </tt></dt>

<dd>(<i>a.k.a.</i> <tt>Universal Format</tt>) This optimisticlly-named
format has been the designated radar data exchange format since 1981
(see SESAME News in <cite>The Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society,</cite>
Nov 1981).  However, the format does not allow sufficient description to
allow easy use with current airborne radar systems. <p>

<A HREF="#OPTS">OPTIONS</A> flags for this format are
UF_360_MAX_SECTOR and UF_FORCE_EOF_VOLS. Max sector forces a new sweep
whenever the antenna has swept through a total of 360 degrees and
force vols causes a new volume to be defined whenever and EOF is
encountered in the input stream.
<p>

Additional environment variables are MAX_UF_CELLS, RENAME,
WATCH_FIXED_ANGLE, GENERATE_SUBSECOND_TIMES,
FORCE_EOF_VOLS,
and INPUT_FILES_LIST which
points to a file containing more than one source device name. This
variable takes precedence over the SOURCE_DEV variable. 
<p>
Since the number of cells/bins/gates is fixed for DORADE for a given
volume, and the number of gates in UF can vary from field to field and
ray to ray, MAX_UF_CELLS fixes the DORADE cell vector size in case the
number of gates is varying in the UF data.<P>

RENAME expects a set of ordered triplets of the form "old_name <
new_name" for changing the radar name (spaces are
manditory).<P>
 WATCH_FIXED_ANGLE begins a new sweep when the fixed angle
changes in case the sweep number doesn't
change.<P>
 GENERATE_SUBSECOND_TIMES addresses the situation where the
time stamp is to the nearest second and more than one beam is
generated per second. If a nonzero argument is provided it is assumed
to be the fraction of a second increment for subsequent beams within
the same second otherwise a calculation if performed based on the PRF
and the number of samples per beam.<P>
 FORCE_EOF_VOLS forces a new volume
flag even if the volume number has not changed in the source data.

<dd> This is the format of the tapes from NOAA P3s. The project name
must be supplied by the user.<p>

The translators separate the HRD tail radar data as if it were two
radars, and data are designated as fore "TF" or aft "TA" depending on
the tilt angle.

Environment variables unique to this format are: <p>

FORE_ANGLE_LIMITS specifies the
limits of the elevation angles for the data assigned to be the fore
radar.<P>

AFT_ANGLE_LIMITS specifies the limits of the elevation angles for the
data assigned to be the aft radar.<P>

KEEP_ORTHOGONAL_DATA specifies that tail data outside the FORE and
AFT_ANGLE_LIMITS is to be preserved. The default is to discard these
data. These data have the designation TA (e.g. TA43P3).<P>

HRD_RANGE_DELAY specifies the number of initial gates to ignore. e.g.
a value of 19 indicates that the 20th gate should be considered the
first gate of data. The range to the first gate is still the same.<P>

HRD_VOLUME_HEADER specifies a fortran-binary file containing volume
header information in case these data are missing from the beginning
of a particular input file.<P>

<dt><tt><a id="ELDFMT">ELDORA_FORMAT</a></tt></dt>

<dd> Specifies raw ELDORA Field Format
data.
<P>
Environment variables unique to this format are: <p>
TIME_CORRECTION specifies the additive time correction in seconds.<p>
YEAR_OF_DATA specifies the 4 digit year of the data.<p>
ELDORA_VOLUME_HEADER specifies a fortran-binary file containing volume
header information in case these data are missing from the beginning
of a particular input file.<p>

AC_NETCDF_FILES specifies the full path names of one or more netCDF
Aircraft insitu data files.<p>

AC_NETCDF_ALIASES specifies replacment names for the following
variables that were originally assumed to be on the tape.
HGME,
PITCH,
ROLL,
THDG,
VEWC,
VNSC,
VNSC,
LATC,
LONC,
PALT,
UIC,
VIC,
and WIC

<p>
In the following example LAT becomes the field searched for rather
that LATC and the NOT alias implies not to substitude the value from
the aircraft insitu tape for the value on the ELDORA raw tape.
<p>
	<dd><tt>setenv AC_NETCDF_ALIASES "LATC < LAT  PITCH < NOT"</tt><BR><br>

The drift angle is derived from the heading and north-south and
east-west velocitites.<p>

AC_TIME_CORRECTION specifies a additive time correction to the
aircraft time to help synchronize it with the current radar beam time.<p>


<A HREF="#OPTS">OPTIONS</A> flags for this format are:<p>

AC_COMPARE specifies sending navigation information plus the time
stamp to the catalog at the start of each sweep.<p>

DESC_SEARCH specified a search for the next descripter rather than
using the size of the current descripter to move to the beginning of
the next descripter. There were some data sets where parts of
descripters were missing.<p>

ROT_ANG_SECTORS specified using the rotation angle rather than the
azimuth in conjunction with the <A HREF="#AZSC">AZ_SECTORS</a> environment variable.<p>

<P>

Applicable environment variables are: <p>
RENAME which renames the radar.<p>
SITE_NAME to set the radar site name. <p>
PROJECT_NAME to set the project name. <p>
RADAR_LATITUDE in degrees as a decimal fraction. <p>
RADAR_LONGITUDE in degrees as a decimal fraction. <p>
RADAR_ALTITUDE in meters. <p>
RCONST_CORRECTION is an additive correction to reflectivity. <p>
ZDR_BIAS is an additive correction in db. <p>

The following set of environment variables are used to help improve scan
delineation:<p>
NEW_SWEEP_AT_AZ, if set, will cause a new sweep to be started whenever the scan
mode is PPI or SUR and the azimuth crosses the given angle. When used, 
NEW_SWEEP_AT_AZ is typically set to 0.0.<p>
MIN_AZ_DIFF (see <a href="#MIN_AZ_DIFF">MIN_AZ_DIFF</a> under PIRAQ_FORMAT)<p>
MIN_EL_DIFF (see <a href="#MIN_EL_DIFF">MIN_EL_DIFF</a> under PIRAQ_FORMAT)<p>

<dt><tt><A id="FOFFMT">FOF_FORMAT</a> </tt></dt>

<dd> The internal format for NCAR ATD radar data; this format has been
in use for radar data collected from about 1980 through 1995, and was
not originally intended for exchange of radar data.  Use of this
format requires access to an ATD-distributed database containing radar
calibratation and parameter information, grouped by date/project, and
by radar.  This is a compact format, and a lot of ATD ground-based
radar data have been distributed in this form. This format requires the
<A HREF="#OFLD">OUTPUT_FIELDS</a> attribute to specify a list of the
desired output fields.<p>

<dt><tt><a id="SWPFMT">SWEEPFILES_FORMAT</a></tt></dt>

<dd>Sweep files can also be used to produce several products.
See <A HREF="#OFLG">OUTPUT_FLAGS</A>.<p>

There is a feature where the input and the output are sweepfiles. This
feature currently provides for rewriting the files with new correction
factors and remerging of aircraft navigation parameters. This feature
rewrites the input sweepfiles.<p>

</dl>

<dt><b>IO_TYPE</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv IO_TYPE "FB_IO"</tt><BR><br>

This variable specifies that input files are FORTRAN-BINARY files. So
far this

conform completely to the FORTRAN-BINARY convention.<P>

<dt><b><a id="MDTS">MAX_DORADE_TAPE_SIZE</a></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv MAX_DORADE_TAPE_SIZE 4.2</tt><BR><br>

Specifies the approximate maximum number of gigbytes of DORADE output
that can be written to a single physical device.  A switch to the next
device is triggered once this limit has been exceeded during the last
volume dump. <P>

<dt><b> MIN_RAYS_PER_SWEEP</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv MIN_FREE_MB <B>n</b></tt><BR><br>

	<dd><tt>setenv OUTPUT_FIELDS "DZ VP"</tt><BR><br>

This attribute is required for <A HREF="#FOFFMT">FOF_FORMAT</a> in order
to specify which output fields are desired. The above example produces
a dBz field thresholded on the MDS and a velocity field also
thresholded on the MDS. The file ../solo/catalog/fieldlist.job contains
information used to derive fields from the raw data and to decide
which fields can be derived.<P>


<dt><b><A id="OFLG">OUTPUT_FLAGS</a></b></dt>

<dl>
<dt><tt><A id="SWPS">SWEEP_FILES</A> </tt></dt>

<dd> Sweep files are simply the DORADE data broken up into one sweep
per disk file. All of the applicable DORADE headers are included in
the file plus some additional information such as a rotation angle
versus ray table. The files are the basis for functioning in
<b>SOLO</b>. <p> 

<dt><tt><A id="DDAT">DORADE_DATA</A> </tt></dt>

<dd> Data in pure DORADE format are produced by accumulating a volume
of sweep files on the disk and then writing them to tape or disk. It
is not necessary to specify SWEEP_FILES as an additonal output 
in order to produce DORADE,
but the presence of the SWEEP_FILES flag will prevent deletion of
sweep files after a dorade volume has been written out if that is
desirable.  <A HREF="#DPSF">PRESERVE_SWEEP_FILES</A> can also be used
to preserve a file periodically.  Aircraft data are often broken into
smaller volumes based on the <A
HREF="#DVOLI">DORADE_VOLUME_INTERVAL</A>.  For disk files the software
manufactures the name of the file with the form
"dor.920128010203.TA-ELDR.0"; i.e., a file type prefix, the date-time,
the radar name and version number. 
See also <A HREF="#DDEV">DORADE_DEV</A>.<p>

Environment variables unique to DORADE_DATA are:<p>

MAX_VOLUME_SIZE in megabytes.<p>

DORADE_VOLUME_INTERVAL Volumes of aircraft data are often very
long. This variable is the maximum length in seconds of a volume of
data. Normally for ground based data it is desirable to respect the
volume boundaries of the original data.<p>

MAX_MEDIA_SIZE in megabytes.<p>

MIN_VOLUME_TIME_SPAN in seconds.<p>

MIN_TIME_GAP in seconds before going to a new volume.<p>

PRESERVE_SWEEP_FILES (default = 0) specifies 
preserving a sweep file every N seconds for
each radar during DORADE output.<p>

DORADE_IO_TYPE " BINARY_IO PHYSICAL_TAPE".<p>

DORADE_DEV If the string "<tt>/dev</tt>" occurs anywhere in this
specification, the software assumes you will be writing to tape(s); if
not, the software assumes you are specifying a destination directory
for DORADE data different from the <A HREF="#DDIR">DORADE_DIR</A>
directory. The name of the file will be manufactured by the
translator program. <p>

<dt><tt><A id="DUFD">UF_DATA</A> </tt></dt>

<dd> The UF data are produced on a ray-by-ray basis as each ray of
source data is read in.  In the absence of the <A
HREF="#UFDIR">UF_DIRECTORY</A> variable, UF files will be produced in
<A HREF="#DDIR">DORADE_DIR</A>.  These UF files will have the form
"ufd.921214163454.LF43P3.0.tape" and will be produced in fortran-binary format.
<p>
Other applicable environment variables for UF_DATA are:<p>
UF_OUTPUT_FIELDS "DBZ NCP VR" causes output of only the fields listed
otherwise all source fields are output.<p>

OPTIONS "NO_UF_CLIP UF_VOL_TRAP" The option NO_UF_CLIP forces the gate
count to be the same for all rays otherwise the ray ends at the last
good gate. UF_VOL_TRAP monitors the fixed angle and triggers a new
volume when the current fixed angle is less than or equal to the
previous fixed angle.<p>

UF_ALIASES. a set of ordered triples "DBZ -> DZ" to rename source
fields before they are written out. The first element is the source
name the second is an arbitrary separator and the third is the new
name. Elements need to be separated by white space<p>
MAX_MEDIA_SIZE in megabytes.<p>

UF_DEV "TF > /dev/nrsx0  TA > /dev/nrsx1". This variable is most often
used when going directly from an input to tape output. The arguments
are ordered triples where the first element is a unique subset of the
radar name, the second is a separator and the third is the device name
all separated by white space.


<dt><tt>NO_UFEOFS </tt></dt>

radar. This option also works for selecting a particular radar from UF
data. <P>

<dt><b>SITE_NAME </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SITE_NAME "FRONTRNG"</tt><BR><br>

Supplies a site name for UF production.<P>

<dt><b><A id="SDEV">SOURCE_DEV</a></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SOURCE_DEV "/dev/nexa"</tt><BR><br>

This <b><u>mandatory</b></u> variable specifies the name of the source
device or the full path name of the source file. The presence of
"/dev" in the name causes the program to assume you are reading from a
physical device.  In the case of DORADE the program will also try to
distinguish between a pure binary file and a fortran-binary
file. Fortran-binary files are different in that they have a 4-byte
header and trailer around each record indicating the length of the
record in bytes. On most other formats the assumption is that a disk
file is in fortran-binary form.<P>

<dt><b>SOURCE_TAPE_ID </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SOURCE_TAPE_ID "P70066"</tt><BR><br>

Causes the specified string to be included in the catalog as a source
tape identifier.<P>

<dt><b>SWEEP_COUNT </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SWEEP_COUNT 11</tt><BR><br>

Specifies the maximum number of sweeps that the program can generate
for each radar. <p>

<dt><b>SWEEP_MODES </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SWEEP_MODES "PPI SUR"</tt><BR><br>

Causes data for the sweep modes not listed to be excluded. The default
is to include all modes.<P>


<dt><b>SWEEP_SKIP</b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SWEEP_SKIP n</tt><BR><br>

Causes the program to skip n sweeps for each radar after reading in a
sweep for each radar; i.e., a SWEEP_SKIP of 1 means that every other
sweep is used.<P>


<dt><b>SWEEP_TRIP_ANGLE </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SWEEP_TRIP_ANGLE 0.0</tt><BR><br>

This applies primarily to HRD and ELDORA data and specifies that when
the antenna rotation angle passes through 0.0 degrees, this is the
start of a new sweep. It is most likely that this option is not
necessary, since the software will automatically sum the deltas between
consecutive rotation angles and declare a new sweep when the accumulated sum of
the deltas, plus the current delta, is greater than 360 degrees.<P> 

<dt><b>SWEEP_TRIP_DELTA </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv SWEEP_TRIP_DELTA 45.0</tt><BR><br>

This applies primarily to HRD and ELDORA data and specifies that
whenever there is a gap of at least 45 degrees between consecutive
rotation angles, a new sweep is declared. The default value is 100
degrees.<P> 

<dt><b>TIME_DEFINED_VOLUMES </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv TIME_DEFINED_VOLUMES ""</tt><BR><br>

This permits the user to define volumes based on the TIME_LIMITS
variable below. i.e. each set of time limits defines a volume.
<P> 

<dt><b><a id="TMLM">TIME_LIMITS</a> </b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv TIME_LIMITS "12/22/92:17:30 < 17:59"</tt><BR><br>

Specifies one or more ordered pairs of time segments consisting of a
start time and a stop time, separated by a "&lt;". The limits are
inclusive and all data outside these limits will be excluded. The
program will stop at the latest stop time. Be sure to
reinclude the date when the times cross midnight. YEARS are
represented as YEAR-1900 or the 4-digit year.<P>

<dt><b><a id="UFDEV">UF_DEV</a></b></dt>
	<dd><tt>setenv UF_DEV "TF > /dev/nrsx0  TA > /dev/nrsx1"</tt><BR><br>

In producing UF, data for each radar selected is written to a separate
file or output device.  If "/dev" is present anywhere in this string,
the program assumes you are specifying a separate physical device for
each radar.<P>


	<dd><tt>setenv UF_DIRECTORY "/scr/mead/uf_dir"</tt><BR><br>

Causes UF files to be written to this directory instead of the
DORADE_DIR.<P>
