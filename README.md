# lrose-solo3

This README is for version 3.00 of solo and xltrs

This is version 3 of the NCAR solo polar radar viewer and editor.

This is effectively the the soloii application, converted to C++.
It depends on updated version of the gtk libraries.

## Downloading

Check out from

  https://github.com/NCAR/lrose-solo3

## Dependencies

To build solo3, you need to install:

  X11-dev
  gtk+-2.0-dev
  gtkmm-2.4-dev
  glib-2.0-dev
  glibmm-2.4-dev

For some RedHat releases, the libraries may be named:

  libX11-devel
  gtk+-devel
  gtkmm24-devel
  glib-devel
  glibmm24-devel

## Building

Use configure to build solo. For example:

  runAutoConf.py
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make
  make install

If you are compiling on Centos, you will need to explicitly create an m4
subdirectory for the autoconf utilities to use and include the --enable-centos
flag on your configure command line.  For example:

  mkdir m4
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-centos

The following apps are installed:

  solo3 (previously soloii)
  xltrs3 (previously xltrsii)
  ddex3 (previously ddex)
  nx_reblock3 (previously nx_reblock)

## Notes for 64-bit OS build

solo3 is natively supported on 64-bit operating systems.

Therefore the build should be the same on both 32-bit and 64-bit
operating systems.

## Change Log - including soloii versions

### version 3.00 (2012/05/14):
  o upgraded to C++
  o 64-bit native support
  o GUI components modified to use gtkmm widgets
  
### version 1.20 (2010/12/6):
  o fixed memory overruns which were causing problems when changing display
    configuration, e.g., when loading saved configuration files
  
### version 1.19: 
  o actually tell people that we cannot display floating-point DORADE data,
    rather than just silently drawing a bunch of gray
  o bump maximum gate count we handle from 1500 to 8192
  o disable tape I/O on systems without /usr/include/sys/mtio.h (e.g.,
    Mac Snow Leopard)
  o add "-m32" flag to compilation and linking for builds on OS X, to
    force making 32-bit executables
    
### version 1.18: Introduce first-cut support for Mac OS X.  Solo3 has been
tested briefly (on a Leopard x86 system), and will display and perform
basic edits on DORADE sweep files.

### version 1.17: For xltrsii, fixed a problem where the Nyquist velocity 
written into sweep files was retained from sweep to sweep, even when 
PRT changed between sweeps.

### version 1.16: Added directions for building on 64-bit systems.  Added xltrsii
support for PIRAQX rev 2 data (generated by newer ARC HiQ systems).  Added
documentation for PIRAQX options in translate/README.xltrsii.html.

### version 1.15: Cleaned code to make it work with newer compilers without 
generating warnings and made configure more robust.

### version 1.14: Added yum netcdf install paths to configure script. 

### version 1.13: Fixed some bugs for Dorade to netCDF conversion.

### version 1.12:   For linux machines compiles with the -m32 flag to 
force 32 bit compiles on 64 bit machines.

### version 1.11: Changed the mode permissions for open/creat calls to 666.

### version 1.10: Updates for Fedora Core 4.

### version 1.09: Found bug in logging code.  String sizes
were not large enough.

### version 1.08:  Hooked up logging function for examine widget.

### version 1.07:  Modified translators to work with new WSR88D 
archive II format.
